        The Council of Eight Ministers, or Ashta Pradhan Mandal, was an administrative 
        and advisory council set up by Shivaji. It consisted of eight ministers who regularly
         advised Shivaji on political and administrative matters. The eight ministers were as follows:

    <h2>Promotion of Marathi and Sanskrit</h2>

    <p>
        In his court, Shivaji replaced Persian, the common courtly language in the region, with Marathi, and emphasised Hindu political and 
        courtly traditions. Shivaji’s reign stimulated the deployment of Marathi as a tool of systematic description and understanding.
         Shivaji's royal seal was in Sanskrit. Shivaji commissioned one of his officials to make a comprehensive lexicon to replace Persian 
         and Arabic terms with their Sanskrit equivalents. This led to production of ‘Rājavyavahārakośa’, the thesaurus of state usage in 1677. 
    </p>
    <h2>Religious policy</h2>
    <img src="../images/Sajjangad.jpg" alt="Sajjangad" class="images">
    <p>
        Though Shivaji was a proud Hindu and never compromised on his religion, he is also known for his liberal and tolerant religious policy.
         While Hindus were relieved to practice their religion freely under a Hindu ruler, Shivaji not only allowed Muslims to practice without 
         harassment, but supported their ministries with endowments. When Aurangzeb imposed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims on 3 April 1679, Shivaji
          wrote a strict letter to Aurangzeb criticising his tax policy. He wrote: <br>
        In strict justice, the Jizya is not at all lawful. If you imagine piety in oppressing and terrorising the Hindus, you ought to first levy
         the tax on Jai Singh I. But to oppress ants and flies is not at all valour nor spirit. If you believe in Quran, God is the lord of all
          men and not just of Muslims only. Verily, Islam and Hinduism are terms of contrast. They are used by the true Divine Painter for blending
           the colours and filling in the outlines. If it is a mosque, the call to prayer is chanted in remembrance of God. If it is a temple, the
            bells are rung in yearning for God alone. To show bigotry to any man's religion and practices is to alter the words of the Holy Book. <br>
        Noting that Shivaji had stemmed the spread of the neighbouring Muslim states, his contemporary, the poet Kavi Bhushan stated: <br>
        Had not there been Shivaji, Kashi would have lost its culture, Mathura would have been turned into a mosque and all would have been circumcised. <br>
        However, Gijs Kruijtzer, in his book Xenophobia in Seventeenth-Century India argues that the roots of modern communalism (the
         antagonism between “communities” of Hindus and Muslims) first appeared in the decade 1677-1687, in the interplay between Shivaji 
         and the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.  During the sack of Surat in 1664, Shivaji was approached by Ambrose, a Capuchin monk who asked him 
         to spare the city's Christians. Shivaji left the Christians untouched, saying "the Frankish Padrys are good men." <br>
        Shivaji was not attempting to create a universal Hindu rule. He harboured tolerance and syncretism towards other religions. He urged
         Aurangzeb to act like Akbar in according respect to Hindu beliefs and places. Shivaji had no difficulty in allying with the 
         surrounding Muslim states even against Hindu powers. Also, he did not ally with other Hindu powers, such as the Rajputs to rebel 
         against the Mughals. In his own army, Muslim leaders appear quite early. The first Pathan unit joined in 1656. Darya Sarang, his naval
          admiral was a Muslim. Older Maratha histories asserted that Shivaji was a close follower of Ramdas, a Brahmin teacher, who guided 
          him in an orthodox Hindu path. However, recent research has shown that Shivaji did not meet or know Ramdas until late in his life. 
          Rather, Shivaji used his own judgment throughout his career.

    <h2>Rajmudra(seal)</h2>

    <p>
        Seals were means to confer authenticity on official documents. Shahaji and Jijabai had Persian seals. But Shivaji, right from beginning,
         used Sanskrit for his seal. The seal proclaims: "This seal of Shiva, son of Shah, shines forth for the welfare of the people and is
          meant to command increasing respect from the universe like the first phase of the moon."
