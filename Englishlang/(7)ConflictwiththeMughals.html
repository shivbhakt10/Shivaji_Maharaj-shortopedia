    <h1>Conflict with Mughals</h1>
    <p>
        Until 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire.
         Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb who then, was the Mughal viceroy
          of the Deccan and son of the Mughal emperor, in conquering Bijapur in return
           for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages under
            his possession. Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better
             offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan. Shivaji's
              confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's
               officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar. This was followed by
                raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses.
                 Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the 
                 forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against
                  Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battle of succession with
                   his brothers for the Mughal throne following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan

    <h2>Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat</h2>

    <p>
        Upon the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, sent his maternal
         uncle Shaista Khan, with an army numbering over 150,000 along with a powerful artillery division
          in January 1660 to attack Shivaji in conjunction with Bijapur's army led by Siddi Jauhar. Shaista
           Khan, with his better–equipped and –provisioned army of 80,000 seized Pune. He also took the nearby
            fort of Chakan, besieging it for a month and a half before breaching the walls. Shaista Khan pressed
             his advantage of having a larger, better provisioned and heavily armed Mughal army and made inroads
              into some of the Maratha territory, seizing the city of Pune and establishing his residence at
               Shivaji's palace of Lal Mahal. 
        In April 1663, Shivaji launched a surprise attack on Shaista Khan in Pune, along with a small group of
         men. After gaining access to Khan's compound, the raiders were able to kill some of his wives; Shaista
          Khan escaped, losing a finger in the melee. The Khan took refuge with the Mughal forces outside of Pune,
           and Aurangzeb punished him for this embarrassment with a transfer to Bengal. 
        In retaliation for Shaista Khan's attacks, and to replenish his now-depleted treasury, in 1664 Shivaji sacked
         the port city of Surat, a wealthy Mughal trading centre.

    <h2>Treaty of Purandar</h2>

    <p>
        The attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat enraged Aurangzeb. In response, he sent the Rajput Mirza Raja Jai Singh I
         with an army numbering around 15,000 to defeat Shivaji. Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's forces pressed Shivaji, with
          their cavalry razing the countryside, and their siege forces investing Shivaji's forts. The Mughal commander 
          succeeded in luring away several of Shivaji's key commanders, and many of his cavalrymen, into Mughal service. By
           mid-1665, with the fortress at Purandar besieged and near capture, Shivaji was forced to come to terms with Jai
            Singh. 
        In the Treaty of Purandar, signed between Shivaji and Jai Singh on 11 June 1665, Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his
         forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold hun to the Mughals. Shivaji agreed to become a
          vassal of the Mughal empire, and to send his son Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen, to fight for the Mughals in
           the Deccan as a mansabdar

    <h2>Arrest in Agra and escape</h2>
    <img src="../images/agraarrest&escape.jpg" alt="aa&e" class="images">
    <p>
        In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra (though some sources instead state Delhi), along with his nine-year-old 
        son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb's plan was to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's
         northwestern frontier. However, in the court, on 12 May 1666, Aurangzeb made Shivaji stand behind mansabdārs 
         (military commanders) of his court. Shivaji took offence and stormed out of court, and was promptly placed under 
         house arrest under the watch of Faulad Khan, Kotwal of Agra.
        Shivaji's position under house arrest was perilous, as Aurangzeb's court debated whether to kill him or continue to
         employ him, and Shivaji used his dwindling funds to bribe courtiers to support his case. Orders came from the emperor
          to station Shivaji in Kabul, which Shivaji refused. Instead he asked for his forts to be returned and to serve the
           Mughals as a mansabdar; Aurangzeb rebutted that he must surrender his remaining forts before returning to Mughal 
           service. Shivaji managed to escape from Agra, likely by bribing the guards, though the emperor was never able to 
           ascertain how he escaped despite an investigation. A popular legend says that Shivaji smuggled himself and his son
            out of the house in large baskets, claimed to be sweets to be gifted to religious figures in the city.

    <h2>Peace with the Mughals</h2>
    <p>
        After Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as an intermediary
         between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals. During the period between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb conferred
          the title of raja on Shivaji. Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses. Shivaji at that 
          time sent Sambhaji with general Prataprao Gujar to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam.
           Sambhaji was also granted territory in Berar for revenue collection.Aurangzeb also permitted Shivaji to attack
            the decaying Adil Shahi; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of 
            sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji.
