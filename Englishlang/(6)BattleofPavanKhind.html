    <h1>Battle of Pavan Khind</h1>
    <p>
        Shivaji escaped from Panhala by cover of night, and as he was pursued by the enemy cavalry, his Maratha
         sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande of Bandal Deshmukh, along with 300 soldiers, volunteered to fight to the
          death to hold back the enemy at Ghod Khind ("horse ravine") to give Shivaji and the rest of the army
           a chance to reach the safety of the Vishalgad fort. <br>
        In the ensuing Battle of Pavan Khind, the smaller Maratha force held back the larger enemy to buy time
         for Shivaji to escape. Baji Prabhu Deshpande was wounded but continued to fight until he heard the sound
          of cannon fire from Vishalgad, signalling Shivaji had safely reached the fort, on the evening of 13
           July 1660. Ghod Khind (khind meaning "a narrow mountain pass") was later renamed Paavan Khind ("sacred
            pass") in honour of Bajiprabhu Deshpande, Shibosingh Jadhav, Fuloji, and all other soldiers who
             fought in there.
