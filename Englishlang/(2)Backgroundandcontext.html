    <h1>Background and Context</h1>
    <p>
        In 1636, the Adi Sahi sultanate of Bijapur invaded the kingdoms to its south. The sultanate had
         recently become a tributary state of the Mughal empire. It was being helped by Shahaji, who at
          the time was a chieftain in the Maratha uplands of western India. Shahaji was looking for 
          opportunities of rewards of jagir land in the conquered territories, the taxes on which he 
          could collect as an annuity. <br>
        Shahji was a rebel from brief Mughal service. Shahji's campaigns against the Mughals, supported 
        by the Bijapur government, were generally unsuccessful. He was constantly pursued by the Mughal 
        army and Shivaji and his mother Jijabai had to move from fort to fort. <br>
        In 1636, Shahaji joined in the service of Bijapur and obtained Poona as a grant. Shivaji and 
        Jijabai settled in Poona. Shahaji, being deployed in Bangalore by the Bijapuri ruler Adilshah,
         appointed Dadoji Kondadeo as administrator. Kondadeo died in 1647 and Shivaji took over the
          administration. One of his first acts directly challenged the Bijapuri government. <br>
