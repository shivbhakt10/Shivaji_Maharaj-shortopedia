    <h1>Death and succession</h1>
    <p>
        The question of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complicated. Shivaji confined his son to Panhala in 1678, only to have the prince
         escape with his wife and defect to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then returned home, unrepentant, and was again confined to
          Panhala. <br>
          Shivaji died around 3–5 April 1680 at the age of 50, on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti. The cause of Shivaji's death is disputed.
           British records states that Shivaji dead of bloody flux being sick for 12 days. In a contemporary work in Portuguese, the
            Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa, the recorded cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax. However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author
             of Sabhasad Bakhar, the biography of Shivaji has mentioned fever as the cause of death of Shivaji. Putalabai, the childless
              eldest of the surviving wives of Shivaji committed sati by jumping into his funeral pyre. Another surviving spouse, Sakwarbai,
               was not allowed to follow suit because she had a young daughter. There were also allegations, though doubted by later scholars
               , that his second wife Soyarabai had poisoned him in order to put her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne. <br>
               After Shivaji's death, Soyarabai made plans with various ministers of the administration to crown her son Rajaram rather than her
                stepson Sambhaji. On 21 April 1680, ten-year-old Rajaram was installed on the throne. However, Sambhaji took possession of Raigad
                 Fort after killing the commander, and on 18 June acquired control of Raigad, and formally ascended the throne on 20 July. Rajaram,
                  his wife Janki Bai, and mother Soyrabai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai executed on charges of conspiracy that October.
