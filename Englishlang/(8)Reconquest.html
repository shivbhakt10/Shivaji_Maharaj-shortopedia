    <h1>Reconquest</h1>
    <p>
        The peace between Shivaji and the Mughals lasted until 1670. At that time Aurangzeb became suspicious of the
         close ties between Shivaji and Mu'azzam, who he thought might usurp his throne, and may even have been receiving
          bribes from Shivaji. Also at that time, Aurangzeb, occupied in fighting the Afghans, greatly reduced his army
           in the Deccan; many of the disbanded soldiers quickly joined Maratha service. The Mughals also took away the 
           jagir of Berar from Shivaji to recover the money lent to him a few years earlier. In response, Shivaji launched
            an offensive against the Mughals and recovered a major portion of the territories surrendered to them in a
             span of four months. 
        Shivaji sacked Surat for second time in 1670; the English and Dutch factories were able to repel his attack, but
         he managed to sack the city itself, including plundering the goods of a Muslim prince from Mawara-un-Nahr who
          was returning from Mecca. Angered by the renewed attacks, the Mughals resumed hostilities with the Marathas,
           sending a force under Daud Khan to intercept Shivaji on his return home from Surat, but were defeated in the 
           Battle of Vani-Dindori near present-day Nashik. 
        In October 1670, Shivaji sent his forces to harass the English at Bombay; as they had refused to sell him war
         materiel, his forces blocked English woodcutting parties from leaving Bombay. In September 1671, Shivaji sent 
         an ambassador to Bombay, again seeking materiel, this time for the fight against Danda-Rajpuri. The English had
          misgivings of the advantages Shivaji would gain from this conquest, but also did not want to lose any chance of
           receiving compensation for his looting their factories at Rajapur. The English sent Lieutenant Stephen Ustick
            to treat with Shivaji, but negotiations failed over the issue of the Rajapur indemnity. Numerous exchanges of
             envoys followed over the coming years, with some agreement as to the arms issues in 1674, but Shivaji was 
             never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before his death, and the factory there dissolved at the end of 1682.

        In 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces, was sent to push back the invading force 
        led by the Bijapuri general, Bahlol Khan. Prataprao's forces defeated and captured the opposing general in the
         battle, after cutting-off their water supply by encircling a strategic lake, which prompted Bahlol Khan to sue
          for peace. In spite of Shivaji's specific warnings against doing so, Prataprao released Bahlol Khan, who
           started preparing for a fresh invasion. 
        Shivaji sent a displeased letter to Prataprao, refusing him audience until Bahlol Khan was re-captured.
         Upset by his commander's rebuke, Prataprao found Bahlol Khan and charged his position with only six other
          horsemen, leaving his main force behind. Prataprao was killed in combat; Shivaji was deeply grieved on 
          hearing of Prataprao's death, and arranged for the marriage of his second son, Rajaram, to Prataprao's
           daughter. Anandrao Mohite became Hambirrao Mohite, the new sarnaubat (commander-in-chief of the Maratha 
           forces). Raigad Fort was newly built by Hiroji Indulkar as a capital of nascent Maratha kingdom.
