    <h1>Shivaji Maharaj’s mode of warfare</h1>
    <p>
        Shivaji maharaj maintained a small but effective standing army. The core of Shivaji’s army consisted of peasants of the
         Maratha and Kunbi castes. Shivaji was aware of the limitations of his army. He realised that conventional warfare methods
          were inadequate to confront the big, well-trained cavalry of the Mughals which was equipped with field artillery. As a
           result, Shivaji adopted guerilla tactics which came to know as 'Ganimi Kava'. Shivaji was a master of guerrilla warfare.
            His strategies consistently perplexed and defeated armies sent against him. He realized that the most vulnerable point of
             the large, slow-moving armies of the time was supply. He utilised knowledge of the local terrain and the superior mobility
              of his light cavalry to cut off supplies to the enemy. Shivaji refused to confront in pitched battles. Instead, he lured
               the enemies in difficult hills and jungles of his own choosing, catching them at a disadvantage and routing them. Shivaji
                didn't stick to a particular tactic but used several methods to undermine his enemies as required by circumstances, like
                 sudden raids, sweeps and ambushes and use of psychological pressure.

    <h2>Military</h2>

    <p>
        Shivaji demonstrated great skill in creating his military organisation, which lasted until the demise of the Maratha Empire. His
         strategy rested on leveraging his ground forces, naval forces, and series of forts across his territory. The Maval infantry served
          as the core of his ground forces (reinforced with Telangi musketeers from Karnataka), supported by Maratha cavalry. His artillery
           was relatively underdeveloped and reliant on European suppliers, further inclining him to a very mobile form of warfare. <br>
           Shivaji was contemptuously called a "Mountain Rat" by Aurangzeb and his generals because of his guerilla tactics of attacking enemy
            forces and then retreating into his mountain forts
    </p>
    <h2>Hill forts</h2>

    <p>
        Hill forts played a key role in Shivaji's strategy. He captured important forts at Murambdev (Rajgad), Torna, Kondhana (Sinhagad) and
         Purandar. He also rebuilt or repaired many forts in advantageous locations. In addition, Shivaji built a number of forts; the number 
         "111" is reported in some accounts, but it is likely the actual number "did not exceed 18." The historian Jadunath Sarkar assessed 
         that Shivaji owned some 240–280 forts at the time of his death. Each was placed under three officers of equal status, lest a single
          traitor be bribed or tempted to deliver it to the enemy. The officers acted jointly and provided mutual checks and balance.

    <h2>Navy</h2>

    <p>
        Aware of the need for naval power to maintain control along the Konkan coast, Shivaji began to build his navy in 1657 or 1659, with the
         purchase of twenty galivats from the Portuguese shipyards of Bassein. Marathi chronicles state that at its height his fleet counted
          some 400 warships, though contemporary English chronicles counter that the number never exceeded 160. 
        With the Marathas being accustomed to a land-based military, Shivaji widened his search for qualified crews for his ships, taking on
         lower-caste Hindus of the coast who were long familiar with naval operations (the famed "Malabar pirates") as well as Muslim 
         mercenaries. Noting the power of the Portuguese navy, Shivaji hired a number of Portuguese sailors and Goan Christian converts,
          and made Rui Leitao Viegas commander of his fleet. Viegas was later to defect back to the Portuguese, taking 300 sailors with him. 
        Shivaji fortified his coastline by seizing coastal forts and refurbishing them, and built his first marine fort at Sindhudurg, which
         was to become the headquarters of the Maratha navy. The navy itself was a coastal navy, focused on travel and combat in the littoral
          areas, and not intended to go far out to sea.
