    <h1>Siege of Panhala</h1>
    <p>
        Having defeated the Bijapuri forces sent against him, Shivaji's army marched towards the Konkan and
         Kolhapur, seizing Panhala fort, and defeating Bijapuri forces sent against them under Rustam Zaman
          and Fazl Khan in 1659. In 1660, Adilshah sent his general Siddi Jauhar to attack Shivaji's southern
           border, in alliance with the Mughals who planned to attack from the north. At that time, Shivaji
            was encamped at Panhala fort with his forces. Siddi Jauhar's army besieged Panhala in mid-1660,
             cutting off supply routes to the fort. During the bombardment of Panhala, Siddi Jauhar purchased
              grenades from the English at Rajapur to increase his efficacy, and also hired some English artillerymen
               to assist in his bombardment of the fort, conspicuously flying a flag used by the English. This
                perceived betrayal angered Shivaji, who in December would retaliate by plundering the English
                 factory at Rajapur and capturing four of the factors, imprisoning them until mid-1663. 
        After months of siege, Shivaji negotiated with Siddi Jauhar and handed over the fort on 22 September 
        1660, withdrawing to Vishalgad; Shivaji retook Panhala in 1673.
