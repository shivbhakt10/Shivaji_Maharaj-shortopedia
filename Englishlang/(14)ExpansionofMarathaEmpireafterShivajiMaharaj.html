    <h1>Expansion of Maratha Empire after Shivaji</h1>
    <p>
        Shivaji Maharaj left behind a state always at odds with the Mughals. Soon after his death, in 1681, Aurangzeb launched an offensive
         in the South to capture territories held by the Marathas, the Bijapur based Adilshahi and Qutb Shahi of Golkonda respectively. He
          was successful in obliterating the Sultanates but could not subdue the Marathas after spending 27 years in the Deccan. The period 
          saw the capture, torture, and execution of Sambhaji in 1689, and the Marathas offering strong resistance under the leadership of
           Sambhaji's successor, Rajaram and then Rajaram's widow Tarabai. Territories changed hands repeatedly between the Mughals and the 
           Marathas; the conflict ended in defeat for the Mughals in 1707. 
        Shahu, a grandson of Shivaji and son of Sambhaji, was kept prisoner by Aurangzeb during the 27-year period conflict. After the latter's
         death, his successor released Shahu. After a brief power struggle over succession with his aunt Tarabai, Shahu ruled the Maratha
          Empire from 1707 to 1749. Early in his reign, he appointed Balaji Vishwanath and later his descendants, as Peshwas (prime ministers)
           of the Maratha Empire. The empire expanded greatly under the leadership of Balaji's son, Peshwa Bajirao I and grandson, Peshwa 
           Balaji Bajirao. At its peak, the Maratha empire stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)
            in the north, and Bengal. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmed Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani
             Empire, which halted their imperial expansion in northwestern India. Ten years after Panipat, Marathas regained influence in North 
             India during the rule of Madhavrao Peshwa. 
        In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, Shahu and the Peshwas gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, creating the
         Maratha Confederacy. They became known as Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Bhonsales
          of Nagpur. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a succession struggle in Pune, which became the First Anglo-Maratha War. The
           Marathas remained the pre-eminent power in India until their defeat by the British in the Second and Third Anglo-Maratha wars 
           (1805–1818), which left the Company the dominant power in most of India.
