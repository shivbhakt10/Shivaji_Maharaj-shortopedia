    <h1>Conflict with Bijapur</h1>
    <p>
        In 1646, the 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur and seized the large
         treasure he found there. In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandhar, Kondhana and 
         Chakan. Also, He brought Supa, Baramati and Indapur under his direct control. He used the money found at Torna to build a new fort Raigad,
          which served as his capital for over a decade. After this, Shivaji turned to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan.
           Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by Baji Ghorpade under the
            orders of Bijapuri ruler Mohammed Adilshah, in a bid to contain Shivaji. <br>
        According to Sarkar, Shahaji was released in 1649 after the capture of Jinji secured Adilshah's position in Karnataka. During 1649–1655 Shivaji paused
         in his conquests and quietly consolidated his gains. After his release, Shahaji retired from public life, and died around 1664–1665 in a hunting accident.
          Following his father's release, Shivaji resumed raiding, and in 1656, under controversial circumstances, killed Chandrarao More, a fellow Maratha feudatory
           of Bijapur, and seized the valley of Javali, near present-day Mahabaleshwar, from him. In addition to the Bhonsale and the More families, many others including
            Sawant of Sawantwadi, Ghorpade of Mudhol, Nimbalkar of Phaltan, Shirke, Mane and Mohite also served Adilshahi of Bijapur, many with Deshmukhi rights. Shivaji adopted
             different strategies to subdue these powerful families such as marrying their daughters, dealing directly with village Patil to bypass the Deshmukhs, or fighting them.
