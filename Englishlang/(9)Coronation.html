    <h1>Coronation</h1>
    <p>
        Shivaji had acquired extensive lands and wealth through his campaigns, but lacking a formal title, he was still
         technically a Mughal zamindar or the son of a Bijapuri jagirdar, with no legal basis to rule his de facto domain.
          A kingly title could address this and also prevent any challenges by other Maratha leaders, to whom he was
           technically equal. it would also provide the Hindu Marathas with a fellow Hindu sovereign in a region otherwise
            ruled by Muslims. 
        The preparation for the proposed coronation began in 1673. However, some controversial problems delayed the
         coronation by almost a year. Controversy erupted amongst the Brahmins of Shivaji's court: they refused to 
         crown Shivaji as a king because that status was reserved for those of the kshatriya (warrior) varna in Hindu
          society. Shivaji was descended from a line of headmen of farming villages, and the Brahmins accordingly
           categorised him as being of the shudra (cultivator) varna. They noted that Shivaji had never had a sacred 
           thread ceremony, and did not wear the thread, which a kshatriya would. Shivaji summoned Gaga Bhatt, a
            pandit of Varanasi, who stated that he had found a genealogy proving that Shivaji was descended from 
            the Sisodia Rajputs, and thus indeed a kshatriya, albeit one in need of the ceremonies befitting his
             rank. To enforce this status, Shivaji was given a sacred thread ceremony, and remarried his spouses
              under the Vedic rites expected of a kshatriya. However, following historical evidence, Shivaji's claim
               to Rajput, and specifically Sisodia ancestry may be interpreted as being anything from tenuous at best,
                to inventive in a more extreme reading. 
        On 28 May, Shivaji performed penance for not observing Kshatriya rites by his ancestors' and himself for so
         long. Then he was invested by Gaga Bhatt with the sacred thread. On insistence of other Brahmins, Gaga Bhatt
          dropped the Vedic chant and initiated Shivaji in a modified form of the life of the twice-born, instead of 
          putting him on a par with the Brahmins. Next day, Shivaji made atonement for the sins, deliberate or accidental,
           committed in his own lifetime. He was weighed separately against seven metals including gold, silver and 
           several other articles like fine linen, camphor, salt, sugar etc. All these metals and articles along with
            a lakh of hun were distributed among the Brahmins. But even this failed to satisfy the greed of the Brahmins.
             Two of the learned Brahmins pointed out that Shivaji, while conducting his raids, had burnt cities involving
              the death of Brahmins, cows, women and children and he could be cleansed of this sin for a price of Rs.
               8,000, and Shivaji paid this amount. Total expenditure made for feeding the assemblage, general alms
                giving, throne and ornaments approached 1.5 million Rupees. 
        Shivaji was crowned king of Maratha Swaraj in a lavish ceremony on 6 June 1674 at Raigad fort. In the Hindu
         calendar it was on the 13th day (trayodashi) of the first fortnight of the month of Jyeshtha in the year 1596.
          Gaga Bhatt officiated, holding a gold vessel filled with the seven sacred waters of the rivers Yamuna, Indus, 
          Ganges, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and Kaveri over Shivaji's head, and chanted the Vedic coronation mantras.
           After the ablution, Shivaji bowed before Jijabai and touched her feet. Nearly fifty thousand people gathered 
           at Raigad for the ceremonies. Shivaji was entitled Shakakarta ("founder of an era") and Chhatrapati 
           ("sovereign"). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith). 
        Shivaji's mother Jijabai died on 18 June 1674. The Marathas summoned Nischal Puri Goswami, a tantrik priest,
         who declared that the original coronation had been held under inauspicious stars, and a second coronation was 
         needed. This second coronation on 24 September 1674 had a dual-use, mollifying those who still believed that 
         Shivaji was not qualified for the Vedic rites of his first coronation, by performing a less-contestable 
         additional ceremony.
